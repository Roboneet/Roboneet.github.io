<h2>An open source journey</h2>
<i>Ever since I got selected to GSoC’18 program, I’ve been explaining what open source is to how amazing julia is to almost everyone I meet. Here’s an intro into how I got into open source and a small summary of my gsoc project that was done during the summer of 2018.</i>

<h3>Open what?</h3>

<p><i>“Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software whose source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose” </i> - Wikipedia</p>

<p>If you’ve ever tried downloading youtube videos, you’d probably know <a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/">this</a> cool software developed by thousands of contributors (If not, here it is...).  Simply stated, all of the software for which it’s code is available for free* is an open-source software. People collaborate on creating open source softwares through websites like <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>. </p>

<p>Getting into open source is a good way to learn things. I started contributing to open source during the past summers while I was just learning how to use the Django framework. All the work done by student teams on BITS campus (including the fest websites, quizzing software code etc) are all made open and we collaborate using Github. As a part of all the little bit mentoring that I’ve done (on and off campus), I’ve cumulated a small list of stuff that you need to know to start contributing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ldJKpwrZpWU6vyOpWTVtHsABQ8hl6Taeu86wLD-EZ7c/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>

<h3>and GSoC?</h3>

<p>To all the people who have no idea what my <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6379515417198592">GSoC project</a> is: </p>

<p>Over the summer, I worked on taking deep learning models made using Flux.jl to the web, specifically to <a href="http://fluxml.ai">http://fluxml.ai</a>. This process includes making models using Flux, training them, creating an interface, and converting the models into javascript using FluxJS.jl. Also, got a few features added to FluxJS.jl including support for various layers and functions. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://roboneet.github.io/blog/posts/final.html">Here</a>’s a more detailed description of the models and the features.

<p>GSoC has been a wonderful experience. It was all those small moments that went from “Oh no, I’m dead :/ ” to “Yes! I can die now!” that made it special (literally). I learned a lot more than I could’ve hoped for and it couldn’t have been better. Right now, I’m a walking advertisement for julia on my campus (obv). Hopefully, more Flux models will come up in the near future… :)
</p>
<p>Also, I got a chance to attend and present a <a href="/assets/posters/juliacon.pdf">poster</a> at Juliacon 2018. The community was very welcoming. To be honest, it was perfect and way beyond my expectations. The most awesome part was meeting my mentors and people on slack for real. I’m totally looking forward to the next one. Thanks to the julia project and numfocus for making this possible.</p>

<p>I can’t thank my mentor, <a href="https://github.com/MikeInnes">Mike Innes</a> enough for making this happen (#bestMentorEver). <a href="https://github.com/xorJane">Jane Herriman</a> has also been very helpful during this project and especially for attending JuliaCon. Work done by <a href="https://github.com/tejank10">Tejan Karmali</a> and <a href="https://github.com/avik-pal/">Avik Pal</a> (fellow GSoC-ers) have been vital in the development of my project and my parents have always been the unsung heroes who motivate me to do my best.
